<p><strong>What is the keyboard interaction missing?</strong><br>
In the original accordion, the only keyboard support came from the default &lt;button&gt; behavior (Tab + Enter/Space). It was missing the ARIA-recommended navigation keys, such as Arrow Up / Arrow Down to move between accordion headers.</p>

<p><strong>What is the ARIA missing?</strong><br>
In the original code, there was no ARIA at all on the accordion: no aria-expanded on the buttons to indicate open/closed state, no aria-controls to link each button to its panel, no role=region or aria-labelledby on the panels, and no aria-hidden to mark collapsed content as hidden.</p>
